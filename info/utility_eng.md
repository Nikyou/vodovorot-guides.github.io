# Talents

The main utility abilities available to shaman:
* [Spirit Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260878) – damage reduction while in [Ghost Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2645), used in high keys to reduce unavoidable damage. Choice node with [Thunderous Paws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378075).
* [Thunderous Paws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378075) – removes Snare effect when using [Ghost Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2645), situational talent in certain dungeons. Choice node with [Spirit Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260878).
* [Spirit Walk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58875) – movement speed buff that removes any Slow effects. Choice node with [Gust of Wind](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192063).
* [Gust of Wind](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192063) – "jump" that can be used to mitigate some forced movement mechanics. Choice node with [Spirit Walk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58875).
* [Earthbind Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2484) - baseline ability. An AoE slow effect, useful in certain dungeons.
* [Earthgrab Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51485) – an upgrade to [Earthbind Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2484) that additionally roots targets the first time they are affected by the totem.
* [Capacitor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058) – an AoE stun, a very useful talent in all dungeons.
* [Cleanse Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51886) – removes Curse effect from friendly target, useful ability in certain dungeons.
* [Wind Rush Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077) – an AoE movement speed increase, situational talent that allows you to save time between packs.
* [Purge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370/) – purges Magical effect from an enemy, useful ability in certain dungeons.
* [Jet Stream](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462817) - a situational upgrade to [Wind Rush Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077) that adds Snare removal. Be mindful that Snare removal only only happens when buff is applied and not when buff is refreshed.
* [Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51514) – CC ability that works on Humanoids and Beasts, very rarely used in dungeons.
* [Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143) – removes Fear, Charm, and Sleep effects from friendly targets, situational talent, as almost all Fear, Charm, and Sleep effects in dungeons can be avoided by interrupting casts or leaving the affected area. Choice node with [Poison Cleansing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383013).
* [Poison Cleansing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383013) – removes Poison effects from friendly targets, useful ability in certain dungeons. Choice node with [Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143).
* [Thunderstorm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51490) - elemental only baseline ability. An AoE that knocks away enemies, useful to get enemies away from you or other players. Can also be used as a stun substitude for interrupts (be mindful of a knockback effect).

# Legend
* ? - low impact, taking and using this ability for this alone is not worth in most cases.
* *no indication* - moderate impact, taking and using this ability is recommended.
* **!** - strong impact, a must have pick in most cases.

# Affixes

**Affix [Xal'atath's Bargain: Ascendant](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=148):**
* [Thunderstorm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51490) – destroys all orbs in the radius.
* [Capacitor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058) – destroys all orbs in the radius.
* [Purge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370/) – purges an orb.

* [Cleanse Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51886) – removes a curse from the player.
* [Poison Cleansing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383013) – greatly simplifies this affix, one use of the totem will remove poisons from all players (after a period of 1.5 seconds).
