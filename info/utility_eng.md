## Talents

* [Thunderstorm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51490) with [Thundershock](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378779) – an AoE interrupt with a short cooldown, but only in melee.
* [Thunderous Paws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378075) – situational talent to remove slow effects in certain dungeons. The alternative of [Spirit Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260878).
* [Spirit Wolf](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=260878) – used in high keys for reduction of a lot of unavoidable damage. The alternative of [Thunderous Paws](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=378075).
* [Ancestral Guidance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281) – extremely strong healing talent, especially on AoE bursts.
* [Cleanse Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51886) – useful ability in certain dungeons and with the Mythic+ affix [Afflicted](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=135).
* [Purge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370/) – useful ability for most dungeons.
* [Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51514) – rarely used, mostly only with Mythic+ affix [Incorporeal](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=136).
* [Wind Rush Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077) – situational talent, allows you to save time between packs. Taken to get access to the next talent - [Nature's Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=30884/). The alternative of [Earthgrab Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51485).
* [Stoneskin Totem](https://wowhead.com/spell=383017) – a useful save for many dungeons, but only in high keys, when damage without it becomes almost unbearable.
* [Capacitor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058) – an AoE stun, a very useful talent in all dungeons.
* [Poison Cleansing Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=383013) – important in some dungeons, also extremly simplifies Mythic+ affix [Afflicted](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=135).
* [Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143) – almost useless talent, as all fear, mind control, and sleep effects in dungeons can be avoided by interrupting casts or leaving the affected area.
* [Earthgrab Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51485) – not very useful talent that replaces [Earthbind Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2484). The alternative of [Wind Rush Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077).

## Dungeons

**Affix [Incorporeal](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=136):**
* [Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51514) – allows you to control the incorporeal, damage does not break Hex.
